The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on a lot of things and one of those is our ability to interact as a community. There has been no in-person conferences or meetups for over a year now. The Cassandra community has always thrived on sharing with each other at places like ApacheCon and the Cassandra Summit. With Cassandra 4.0, we have a lot to celebrate!

This release will be the most stable database ever shipped, and Cassandra has become one of the most important databases running today. It is responsible for the biggest workloads in the world and because of that, https://hopin.com/events/apache-cassandra-4-0-world-party[we want to gather the worldwide community and have a party,window=_blank].

We thought we would do something different for this special event that reflects who we are as a community. Our community lives and works in every timezone, and we want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to participate so we’ve decided to use an Ignite-style format. If you are new to this here’s how it works:

* Each talk is only 5 minutes long.
* You get ten slides and they automatically advance every 30 seconds.
* To get you started, we have a template ready https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cWta8H88xXolEdS-HFo9nzp1GI5v_VkCHo5dmoKqozY/edit#slide=id.gc922c7a35f_0_106[here,window=_blank].
* You can do your talk in the language of your choice. English is not required.
* Format: PDF (Please no GIFs or videos)

When you are ready, you can use https://sessionize.com/cassandra[this link to submit your talk idea,window=_blank] by April 9, 2021. It’s only five minutes but you can share a lot in that time. Have fun with the format and encourage other people in your network to participate. Diversity is what makes our community stronger so if you are a newcomer, don’t let that put you off – we’d love you to share your experiences.
