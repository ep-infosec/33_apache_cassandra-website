=== Calling all developers!

The Apache Cassandra community invites you to join an action-packed day of superhero events held simultaneously across 3 cities on November 10 -- *Santa Clara* CA, *Bellevue* WA and *Houston* TX!

=== Background

Cassandra Days focus on the open source Apache Cassandra project and the community that supports the project. Everyone (whether they are an individual user, contributor, or company) is welcome to attend and help organize these events.

These events are an opportunity for Apache Cassandra users, enthusiasts, and community members to share their experiences working with Cassandra daily, hear talks and participate in workshops for NoSQL beginners & experts.

=== Event info

WORKSHOP - Attend in-person in one of the cities and join us for complimentary two-hour hands-on workshop to learn how to build applications on Cassandra. Participants receive a voucher to take the Cassandra test at a later date to get certified.

MEETUP - We celebrate the return of in-person Cassandra meetups with speakers from *Netflix*, *Intel*, *Quine* & *DataStax*. There will be lots of food, drinks and time to network PLUS t-shirts and prizes!

MOVIE - Bring a guest to end the day with an exclusive private screening of *Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* -- a Cassandra appreciation event sponsored by *DataStax* and *Intel*!
